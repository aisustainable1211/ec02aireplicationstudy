# Eco2AI Replication Study

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for my replication study. The goal was to replicate and critically assess the emission-tracking capabilities of the Eco2AI library (Budennyy et al., 2022).

## Contents

- `Global_Challenges_Replication_Study.ipynb`: Main notebook with fully executable code and outputs
- `emission.csv`: Log file automatically generated by Eco2AI containing emissions data
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

## Replication Details

This study re-implements the Eco2AI convolutional neural network (CNN) model using the MNIST dataset, with variation in epochs and batch sizes across three runs:
- Run 1: 3 epochs, batch size 256  
- Run 2: 2 epochs, batch size 128  
- Run 3: 4 epochs, batch size 64

## How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter
2. Install dependencies:
   ```python
   !pip install eco2ai numpy pandas matplotlib pillow torch torchvision
3. Run all cells from top to bottom.
4. The final emissions table will appear at the end, and emission.csv will be generated automatically.
